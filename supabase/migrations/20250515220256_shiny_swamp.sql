  # Update patients table RLS policies
  
  1. Changes
    - Drop existing ALL policy
    - Create separate policies for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
    - Fix INSERT policy syntax by removing USING clause
    
  2. Security
    - Maintain existing security model where only administrators and doctors can manage patients
    - Keep existing view permissions intact
