/*
  # Update patients table RLS policies

  1. Changes
    - Split the ALL policy into separate policies for each operation
    - Add explicit policies for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
    - Keep existing SELECT policy unchanged
    
  2. Security
    - Administrators and doctors can perform all operations
    - Nurses can only view patients
    - All policies are permissive
